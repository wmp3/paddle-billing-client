Adjustments

Adjustment object

Adjustment entities describe a post-billing adjustment to a billed or completed transaction.

Billed transactions are considered financial records for tax and legal purposes, so they can't be changed. Adjustments let you record actions that impact revenue for a transaction after it's been billed.

You can create adjustments for billed or completed transactions to refund or credit all or part of a transaction. Refunds must be approved by Paddle.

Paddle creates adjustments automatically for successful customer chargebacks, as well as subscription lifecycle events depending on the proration options chosen.

Adjustment entities hold information like:

What kind of adjustment it is

Why the adjustment was created

Which transaction and items an adjustment is for
